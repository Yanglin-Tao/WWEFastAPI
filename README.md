# What We Eat
## Backend
This repository is in process of migrating to https://github.com/Yanglin-Tao/WhatWeEat, a web application based on TurboGears2 backend.
### Set up 
Python FastAPI (assume you already installed pip tool and python virtual env), also make sure you have Python 3.11
1. pipenv shell
1. pip install 'fastapi[all]' 
2. pip install uvicorn 
3. pip install sqlalchemy 
4. pip install psycopg2-binary 
### To run backend:
1. Make sure you are in `/WWEFastAPI/WhatWeEat/backend/app` directory
2. Run `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Frontend
### Set up 
React (assuming you already installed React)
1. npm install axios
### To run fronend:
1. Make sure your backend server is up and running
2. Make sure you are in `WWEFastAPI/WhatWeEat/frontend/what-we-eat` directory
3. Run `npm start`


## Database
Postgresql
1. Download Postgresql
2. Create a database named 'whatweeatapp'
3. In pgAdmin4, go to Tools > Query Tool, then run the following queries:
```
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE whatweeatapp TO [your_name];
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO [your_name];
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO [your_name];
ALTER DATABASE "whatweeatapp" OWNER TO "[your_name]";
SELECT * FROM user_profiles;
```
Notice that I used 'yanglintao' in main.py in the backend folder. To avoid merging issues, it's better to use the same name. You can create a new role named 'yanglintao' and set passwords. But feel free to change to your role name as long as you do not commit that change.
